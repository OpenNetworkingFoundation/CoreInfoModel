# CoreInfoModel
The repository holds the work on the ONF open core information model. The current model can be viewed using Papyrus Mars v1.1.1. The explanatory documentation provided here is in raw Gendoc template form. The model is also published with full documentation (after running Gendoc) at https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/TR-512_v1.4_OnfCoreIm-info.zip.
